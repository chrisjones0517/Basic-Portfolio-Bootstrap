                                    <p>My name is Chris Jones, and this is the story of my journey, thus far. I was always fascinated
                                        by technology, and have been of a curious mind when it comes to the inner workings
                                        of technology. I worked as a Master Diagnostic Technician (MDT) for local Toyota
                                        dealerships, where I started as an apprentice mechanic. Eventually, I became highly
                                        recognized in the Toyota community for my understanding of mechanical and electrical
                                        systems, and the logic circuits governing those systems. After several years, although
                                        I was earning a competitive salary at the Toyota dealership, I found an opportunity
                                        at the local utility company, MLGW, which offered a far more comprehensive benefits
                                        package, and a better work/life balance, albeit for slightly less income. I accepted
                                        the position, and after adjusting to a new environment, I again earned a reputation
                                        for having a strong diagnostic and problem solving ability, especially given the
                                        wide array of equipment and responsibility. I was in a secure position, and had a
                                        highly sought after governnment job, but I found myself looking for a new challenge.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The epiphany came to me while at MLGW that I would attain greater job satisfaction in
                                        a field which was centered in ideas more so than jobs which had a strong labor component.
                                        As someone who considers the future, I also realized that intellectual fields are
                                        generally associated with a higher length of service when contrasted with traditional
                                        trades. With this in mind, I began studying mechanical engineering, while also working
                                        full-time at MLGW. I was also living far below my means in an effort to build my
                                        savings. After a few years of picking away at my courses, my savings and investments
                                        reached a point that I had sufficient resources to complete my degree as a full-time
                                        student, without being dependent on a paycheck. I also had a very supporting spouse
                                        (and still have), who received an offer at a company in Houston, TX, so I decided
                                        to resign my position, cash in my investments and savings, and complete my schooling
                                        in Texas. Although I was still maintaining a 4.0 through chemistry, calculus, etc.,
                                        I did a spreadsheet analysis comparing web development to mechanical engineering,
                                        taking into account the cost of schooling, absence from the work force, time until
                                        peak income, etc., and an aspiring web developer was born! I began learning web technologies
                                        through a comprehensive approach, including books, online courses, and YouTube tutorials.
                                        I also discovered that I truly enjoy implementing algorithms and solving problems
                                        using technology. More recently, I used some of my remaining capital to invest in
                                        UT Houston Coding Bootcamp. As of this writing, the course is just beginning, but
                                        I'm excited about the possibilities! </p>

                                        <h3>What I Do</h3>
                                        <p>As of this point, I am confident in my knowlege of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery,
                                            PHP, and mySQL. That being said, the rate at which the preferred technologies
                                            change makes the ability to learn and implement new techology more desirable
                                            than static knowledge, which rapidly becomes obsolete when technologies fade
                                            from the limelight. I am committed to lifelong learning, which I enjoy. I am
                                            willing to tackle any project for which I can access resources to complete. If
                                            an individual or business requests a service in which I lack experience, I am
                                            willing to negotiate on price to compensate for the longer build time. I build
                                            everything from simple responsive websites to complex AI implementations using
                                            the mini-max algorithm, most often combined with alpha-beta pruning. I can write
                                            server side scripts to process your data in mySQL or similar database management
                                            systems. As mentioned in the 'About' section, I'm currently a student of the
                                            UT Houston Coding Bootcamp, so my skills list will be updated over the proceeding
                                            months. </p>
